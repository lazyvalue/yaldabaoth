//! Verification harness — headless GPUI tests (see docs/dev-system.md § Verification harness).
//!
//! The binding constraint on agent throughput is that the GPUI app can't be
//! driven headlessly, so a human is the verification oracle for every change.
//! GPUI ships a real test harness (`#[gpui::test]` + `TestAppContext`, which
//! simulates platform input and runs the async executor via `run_until_parked`)
//! — this module builds on it to drive `SketchGpuiView` (open agent, simulate
//! keystrokes, stream synthetic events, assert state) without a display.
//!
//! `test-support` is enabled via the `gpui` dev-dependency, so this compiles
//! only for test builds — the production binary is unaffected.
//!
//! Stones laid here grow toward: (1) end-to-end action smokes, (2) the
//! O(changed) perf gate at realistic transcript size, (3) golden render output.

// a `register_keymap(app: &mut App)` callable from both `main()` and the harness,
// then `vcx.simulate_keystrokes("cmd-b")` will dispatch through real actions.
